# What is this?

This repository contains the code and content behind the Government Digital
Strategy site as seen online at [http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/ "Government Digital Strategy online publication")

By following the instructions below anyone comfortable with using command line can set up a local, working, copy of the site, and view the content as it appears online.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting to install and run the application, the following dependencies should be installed:

* Node.js (0.8+) and npm.
* Ruby (1.9+) and bundler.


# Before running the build script

Make sure you've got Node & npm installed, and then CD into the directory and run:

```
npm install
```

This uses the `package.json` file to install dependencies.


# Local Build Script

Run the shell script:

```
./local-build.sh
```

This compiles everything into the `built` folder. To view it locally, run `ruby server.rb` and head to `localhost:8080`.


# Production Build Script

The local-build script is great for viewing locally but doesn't do any of the performance stuff we want - minifying CSS, JS and so on. The production build script does.

```
./deploy.sh
```

It will compile and minify the JS. This uses the RequireJS optimizer.

It will also minify all CSS.

Once it's done, you're left with a `deploy/` folder which is the production-ready files. This is what should be put on the server.

If you want to test that the deploy folder works fine, run `ruby deploy-server.rb`, which serves up the `deploy/` folder on port 9090.

The production build script also creates all the PDFs.



# PDF

```
ruby build-pdf.rb --folder source/government-digital-strategy
```

Need to have `wkhtmltopdf` installed and you need to be running the server on localhost:8080

install `wkhtmltopdf` per instructions at http://stackoverflow.com/a/10931279

# Notes

All CSS should be written in Sass (using the SCSS syntax) and live in `assets/sass`

These get compiled to `assets/css`.

__NEVER EDIT A FILE IN built/__. These get overwritten by the build script and are not tracked by Github. The same goes for the `deploy/` folder.

Code, images, etc goes in assets/ and content goes into source/

# Partials and Templates and Syntax

You should check `source/sample-document` for a living demo of how everything works.

Partials live in `source/partials` and should be named with an underscore at the start, eg `_mypartial.html`

A partial can contain Markdown or HTML, just name it as `.md` or `.html`.

To include a Markdown, in either your HTML or MD file, use:

```
{include _action-text.md}
```

That would look for `source/partials/_action-text.md`.

If you include a MD partial in an HTML page, the MD is compiled first.

# Templates

Similarly to partials, for the HTML pages we have templates you can use. These are in `assets/templates/`.

The main line you need to look for is `<!--REPLACE-->`. The contents of the page that uses this template are put into the file, in place of that shortcut.

The line `<!--TIME-->` is replaced with the compilation time. This is mainly for debugging.

The line `<!--META-->` gets replaced with the contents of `meta.html` within the document directory, if there is one. This is where extra stuff to be put in the `<head>` on a per-document basis exists.

To assign a template to a HTML file, insert, at the very top of the HTML file, a tag, for example, here's one of the HTML files that uses the home_template:

```
{home_template}
      <div class="document-title">
        <div class="title">
          <h2>Digital services so good people prefer to use them</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
      ...
</body>
</html>
```

That would look for `asset/templates/home_template.html`. The above contents would be put into the template where `<!--REPLACE-->` is.

The digital documents use the `digital_doc_template.html`. The others use `generic_template.html`. Individual files can use any template they like, as defined above.
# Running It Locally

To view it locally run `ruby server.rb` and visit `http://localhost:8080`

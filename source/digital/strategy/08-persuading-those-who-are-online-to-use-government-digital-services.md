##08 Persuading those who are online to use government digital services

We want those who are able to use our digital services to do so. For
those who can and do use digital services already, the actions outlined
in this strategy will result in a better user experience and a wider
range of high quality digital services.

To persuade people to use government digital services, we need to
improve the quality of the services to make them clearly preferable to
the alternatives.

We also need to make people aware of the services that are available. A
number of techniques can be used to raise awareness and encourage people
to use digital channels. Departments will consider which methods are
most appropriate to the context of their service, and the needs of their
service users.

Departments will learn from the expertise of organisations who have
successfully undertaken 'channel shift' to digital services.

###What about things that can’t be done online?

Not every step of every interaction with government can, or should, be
entirely digitised – a practical driving test can't be taken online.
But even services that inherently involve face to face contact can be
redesigned - digitally - around the needs of users.

For example, while over 90% of practical driving tests are booked
online, driving examiners still fill in and file paper forms to confirm
who has passed their test, adding cost and delay for users that a truly
end-to-end digital service could remove. Driving Standards Agency is
aiming to trial the introduction of mobile devices so that examiners don’t have to
fill in paper forms. They will be able to pass on test information to
the next stages of the process more swiftly and efficiently.

Over time, the success of better designed digital services will allow
government to reduce the scale and profile of less convenient, less effective
and less cost-efficient contact methods (telephony, face to face, post).

###Redesigning services around the needs of users

The most important part of this strategy is the need to redesign
government services to respond to user needs.

We can learn lessons from other organisations which are succeeding in
digital transformation such as high street banks or the BBC:

-   basing service design on user needs is essential to ensure quality
    and reduce the cost of failure waste
-   modern, flexible, common technology platforms are needed for
    frequently iterated, consistent user-focused services
-   policy and delivery are best tightly integrated into one
    co-located team during any redesign of a digital service
-   specialist technical architecture, development, design and
    analytics skills are essential, alongside new senior leadership
    roles, including that of a fully accountable and empowered service
    manager
-   once services are redesigned to meet user needs, they need to be
    communicated and marketed effectively, by targeting appropriate
    messages to identified user groups through a range of trusted
    channels and intermediaries

###How the civil service needs to develop

Measured against the [European Digital Capability Framework](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/events/cf/dae1009/item-display.cfm?id=5379) set out
below, departments are currently at varying levels of digital maturity.

| Maturity | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 5  | Digital is at the heart of policy and strategy. Services are digital by default. Digital culture is strong: agile, user-centred, innovative, responsive. |
| 4  | Senior management have made significant progress in delivering the vision and plan, implementing new capability and trialling it successfully by re-engineering a range of services to be digital by default. |
| 3  | Senior management in place with a remit to set targets, develop over-arching vision and plan, and develop necessary capability and culture. Digital is seen as a key transformation and advocacy is strong at key parts of the organisation. |
| 2  | Some digital services, but often of limited quality. Digital teams in place but tend to be siloed in business units or service/programme teams and have limited budget and remit. Senior (board level) digital management not in place. |
| 1  | No awareness of digital capability, no resources allocated, no digital strategy, plan or metrics, no understanding of best practice, no digital services. |

By taking the approaches and actions set out in Section 9 we will make
progress in all departments towards the highest levels of strong, agile,
responsive and, above all, user-centred digital service provision.

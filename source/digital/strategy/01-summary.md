This strategy sets out how the government will become digital by
default. It fulfils the commitment we made in the [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform).

By digital by default, we mean digital services that are so
straightforward and convenient that all those who can use them will
choose to do so whilst those who can’t are not excluded.

We estimate that moving services from offline to digital channels will
save between £1.7 and £1.8 billion a year.

Government is improving the way it provides information by moving to a
single website, [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/). Transactional services now present the biggest
opportunity to save people time and save the government money.

People will only choose to use government services digitally if they are
far more straightforward and convenient. The vast majority (82%) of the
UK population is online but most people rarely use online government services.

The government provides more than 650 transactional services. There is
only a handful of these services where a significant majority of people who could use the
online option do. Many have a digital option, but few people use it.
Half of these don’t offer a digital option at all.

We will:

####Improve departmental digital leadership

Departmental executive boards will include an active digital leader.
Transactional services handling over 100,000 transactions each year will
be redesigned, operated and improved by a skilled, experienced
and empowered Service Manager.

####Develop digital capability throughout the civil service

All departments will ensure that they have the right levels of digital
capability in-house, including specialist skills. Cabinet Office will
support improved digital capability across departments.


####Redesign transactional services to meet a new digital by default service standard

All departments will undertake end-to-end service redesign of all
transactional services with over 100,000 transactions each year. All new
or redesigned transactional services going live after April 2014 will
meet a new digital by default service standard.

There are 7 departments which between them handle the majority of central government transactions. These are:

- HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)
- Department for Transport (DfT)
- Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
- Ministry of Justice (MoJ)
- Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
- Home Office

Each of these departments will agree 3 significant exemplar service transformations with Cabinet Office. These
will be identified and published in departmental digital strategies in December 2012, alongside delivery plans.
Departments will start to redesign these exemplar services by April 2013
and implement them by March 2015.

####Complete the transition to GOV.UK

Corporate publishing activities of all 24 central government departments
will move onto GOV.UK by March 2013, with agency and arm's length bodies’
online publishing to follow by March 2014.

####Increase the number of people who use digital services

Departments will raise awareness of their digital services so more
people know about and use them, and look at ways to use incentives to encourage digital
adoption.

####Provide consistent services for people who have rarely or never been online

It is important we do not leave anyone behind in this move to a digital
by default approach. Departments will recognise and understand the needs
of people who can't use digital services. We
will provide appropriate support for these people to use digital
services and other ways to access services for people who need them.

####Broaden the range of those tendering to supply digital services including more small and medium sized enterprises

Cabinet Office will offer leaner and more lightweight tendering
processes, as close to the best practice in industry as our regulatory
requirements allow.

####Build common technology platforms for digital by default services

Cabinet Office will lead in the definition and delivery of a new suite
of common technology platforms, to underpin the new generation of
digital by default services.

####Remove unnecessary legislative barriers

Cabinet Office will work with departments to amend legislation that
unnecessarily prevents us from developing straightforward, convenient
digital services.

####Base service decisions on accurate and timely management information

Departments will supply a consistent set of management information, as
defined by Cabinet Office, for their transactional services.

####Improve the way that the government makes policy and communicates with people

Departments will encourage policy teams to use a wider range of digital
tools to communicate with and consult people, both within the UK and
overseas.

This strategy is just the beginning. We recognise
that the changes required will be far from easy. Our existing processes
and ways of working can get in the way, and many will need to change.

By December 2012, each department will publish their own departmental
digital strategy explaining what actions they will take to contribute to
this strategy. These actions will provide a framework for continuing
improvements in their services.

Cabinet Office will operate an annual review process to track
departments’ progress against the actions in this strategy.

The strategy does not cover local government services, the NHS, or ways to increase the digital capability of
UK citizens. It also does not deal with the expansion of the broadband network which is being led by Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).

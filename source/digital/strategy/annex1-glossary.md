##Annex 1 - Glossary

Transactional services
: Transactional services include interactions with
the government, from booking driving tests and filing tax returns to
setting up a company and applying for a public house licence: everything
which involves sharing information, requesting services, buying goods,
asking for permission, or paying money.

Information services
: Information services cover the publishing of information to help citizens and businesses in their engagement with government. For example, in August 2012, one of the most visited informational pages on Directgov listed the dates of forthcoming public holidays.

Digital
: By ‘digital’, we mean internet-enabled; such as desktop,
laptop, tablet, mobile or digital devices not yet invented.

Executive board
: An 'executive board' will typically be a sub-committee of the departmental ministerial board and may also be referred to as 'management board' or 'executive committee'. 
Departments will ensure that there is engaged leadership at sufficiently senior level to make service transformation possible.

API
: An application programming interface (or API) is a way of making
information available to other developers for use in tools and services.
APIs allow developers to use information quickly and easily, and help to
ensure that they can access data in the most efficient way available.

Systems Integrator
: A systems integrator (or SI) is an individual or
business that builds computing systems for clients by combining hardware
and software products from multiple vendors and ensuring that those
subsystems function together.

Small and Medium Sized Enterprises
: Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (or SMEs) are defined by the European Commission as enterprises which
employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not
exceeding €50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding €43 million.

Agile
: An approach where projects and products progress and develop in
incremental iterations. The product works from a very early stage, so
improvement can be made based on real user feedback and testing.

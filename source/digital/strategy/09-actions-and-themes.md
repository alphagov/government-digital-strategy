##09 Principles and actions

We have 14 actions, which we group under 11 principles.

Departments will publish their own digital strategies by the end of 2012
setting out how they and their agencies and arm's length bodies will
apply these principles to transform their own services to make them
digital by default.

### Principle: Improve departmental digital leadership

*"Proven leadership in digital transformation"*

####Action 01: Departmental and transactional agency boards will include an active digital leader

{include action01-case-study.md}

-   departments will have in place engaged, active,
    board-level leadership of service transformation
-   Digital Leaders will lead on development and delivery of
    departmental digital strategies

{: .action-dep-response}



####Action 02: Services handling over 100,000 transactions each year will be re-designed, operated and improved by a skilled, experienced and empowered Service Manager

{include action02-case-study.md}

-   Service Managers will be in place for new and redesigned
    transactions from April 2013
-   departments will ensure all transactional services have clearly
    identified Service Managers by March 2015

Government Digital Service will:

-   offer extensive training and support to help new Service Managers
-   help departments to recruit Service Managers

Private sector organisations that have been at the forefront of
delivering digital transformation have repeatedly indicated the
importance of leadership at all levels to their success. It is therefore
important that we ensure that suitably skilled and empowered leadership
is in place within departments and agencies to lead service
transformation.

Digital Leaders will provide active senior leadership for departmental
digital strategies and activities and provide expertise and challenge to
their boards. Cabinet Office will help boards to identify Digital
Leaders with suitable experience and skills (role specification in Annex
5). These will usually be members of the departmental executive (or
management) board. In a number of departments, these are already in
place.

In agencies and arm's length bodies that deliver significant
transactional services, similar active board-level leadership is
critical to achieving successful service transformation.

Outside government, organisations in the public and private sector are
learning that empowered, experienced and highly skilled managers (often
called Product Managers in the commercial world) are necessary to
deliver high-quality digital services.

Government will adopt the same model, and ensure each of its
transactional digital services handling over 100,000 transactions each year is
developed, operated and continually improved by an experienced,
skilled and empowered Service Manager. 
These are not technical IT posts, nor are they confined to running a
website. Instead, they are individuals who work full-time to develop and deliver
all the changes necessary to provide effective digital services. With a
handful of exceptions, this is a new role within government. These
Service Managers will:

-   be experienced leaders, with an in-depth understanding of their
    service (built on continuity of involvement over a period of years)
    and equipped to represent their service and its users’ needs at all
    levels within the organisation. For high-profile services these will
    be at Senior Civil Servant level
-   be accountable for the quality and usage of their service, and
    able to iterate the service based on user feedback at least every
    month
-   be able to lead effectively on the change management and process
    re-engineering required to implement successful services
-   have the digital literacy to engage with technical staff and
    suppliers to define the best system and platform configurations to
    achieve business/user objectives
-   encourage the maximum possible take-up of their digital service by
    effective marketing, and specify/manage the requirements for
    assisted digital activity to supplement this
-   oversee service redesign and subsequent operational delivery;
    supporting and ensuring the necessary project and approval processes
    are followed, monitoring and reporting on progress in line with the
    digital by default service standard, identifying and mitigating
    risks, and be empowered to deliver on all aspects
-   actively participate in networking with other Service Managers
    inside and outside government, and share good practice and learning

Cabinet Office will help departments to recruit suitably skilled
individuals. Newly appointed Service Managers will be supported by
Cabinet Office through a specialist training programme run by the
Government Digital Service. This will include the hands-on process of
designing and prototyping a digital service.

### Principle: Develop digital capability throughout the civil service

*“Becoming a digital civil service”*

####Action 03: All departments will ensure that they have appropriate digital capability in-house, including specialist skills

{include action03-case-study.md}

-   departments will have sufficient specialist capability to assess
    and manage their portfolio of digital services
-   plans to improve departments’ digital capability will be included
    in departmental digital strategies and business planning processes


[Read how departments are responding to this action »](/digital/strategy/actions/03/)
{: .action-dep-response}

####Action 04: Cabinet Office will support improved digital capability across departments

{include action04-case-study.md}

-   Service Managers will be offered an extensive programme of
    training and support, run by Government Digital Service from summer
    2013
-   senior officials across all departments will be offered training
    to highlight the strategic opportunities offered by digital from
    summer 2013
-   the revised [Graduate Fast Stream programme](http://faststream.civilservice.gov.uk/) will look for placement
    opportunities with a digital delivery service
-   digital skills development across all grades will be a priority in
    the Civil Service Capabilities Plan, likely to be published in November 2012, supported by [Civil
    Service Learning](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/hr/civil-service-learning)

Government Digital Service will:

-   increase support to departments’ transactional service redesign
    projects
-   help departments to improve their digital capability, including
    providing guidance on request about effective approaches to
    recruiting digital specialists
-   develop extensive bespoke training and support for Service
    Managers
-   work with Civil Service Learning to develop digital awareness
    training for civil servants

All departments should ensure that they have appropriate in-house
specialist digital capability, including the management of their
portfolio of digital services. This capability will vary in size and
skill-sets depending on the balance of information and services the
department is responsible for. It will typically include specialist
digital skills in digital service design, development, analytics,
digital strategy, online publishing and product management. Departments
with lower volumes of transactions could share specialist digital
resources.

Government Digital Service is already working with departments to
support 7 transformational service redesign projects. This support
will continue, and be extended. Annex 2 describes the support that is
available.

To complement this internal development, approaches to recruitment will
need to be adapted to attract staff with appropriate skills from outside
government. Departments will also provide opportunities for existing
staff to develop the required digital skills.

#####Specialist training and support for Senior Civil Servants

Government Digital Service will help Civil Service Learning to develop
training for Senior Civil Servants to raise their awareness of the
opportunities offered by digital to improve a wide range of policy
outcomes.

#####Fast Stream and Future Leaders

Digital skills and leadership will be incorporated into the new
government-wide approach to active corporate management of current and
future leadership from Fast Stream through to future Permanent
Secretaries (set out in the [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform)).

Where possible Fast Stream entrants should spend one of their six month
placements during their first two years in a digital role. The new
Future Leaders Scheme will aim to give middle managers operational
management experience in a digitally delivered service area as part of
overall career planning.

#####The wider civil service

General digital training activity across the wider civil service will be
included in the government’s capability building programme, led by Civil
Service Learning. Departments will ensure appropriate levels of digital
skills are part of core competencies, performance and objective-setting
frameworks at all levels.

### Principle: Redesign transactional services to meet a new digital by default service standard

*“Digital services so good that all who can use them, prefer to use them”*

####Action 05: All departments will redesign services handling over 100,000 transactions each year

For the 7 ‘transactional’ departments (HMRC, DfT, DWP, BIS, DEFRA, MoJ, and the Home Office):

-   3 significant ‘exemplar’ services will be agreed with Cabinet
    Office and identified in departmental digital strategies in December 2012, 
    alongside delivery plans
-   redesign will start by April 2013 and the service must be
    implemented by March 2015
-   following this and using the learning from the exemplars,
    departments will redesign all services handling over 100,000
    transactions each year, unless an exemption has been agreed

For the remaining departments:

-   departments will redesign all services handling over 100,000
    transactions each year, unless an exemption has been agreed.

{: .action-dep-response}


####Action 06: From April 2014, all new or redesigned transactional services will meet the digital by default service standard

{include action06-case-study.md}

Government Digital Service will:

-   publish the [digital by default service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default), which will
    describe the performance metrics and capabilities that services must
    achieve. An indicative outline is published in Annex 3
-   provide [a programme of support, guidance and tools](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) that help
    service teams meet the standard throughout the development and life
    of the service
-   agree with departments the deadlines for when digital services are
    to be redesigned
-   increase the scale of its transformation team to support more
    transactional service redesign projects
-   help departments to share what they learn from exemplar projects

Government digital services are inconsistent and often do not meet the
standards that users expect. To ensure that users receive a consistently
high-quality digital experience from government, Cabinet Office will
develop a service standard for all digital
services. No new or redesigned service will go live unless they meet
this standard.

The full standard will be published by the Cabinet Office by April 2013.

In summary, it will require redesigned digital services to:

-   be developed based on user need using agile, iterative, digital
    development methodologies and using open source code by default
-   be designed, run and continually improved by a skilled
    and empowered Service Manager
-   be iterated at least monthly based on qualitative feedback from
    users and quantitative measures from analytics
-   be designed for inclusion, so all who should use it can use it,
    and include appropriate assisted digital support for people who
    can’t
-   offer high-quality APIs, allowing departments to integrate
    services, and make these available to third-parties where there is a
    demonstrable user benefit
-   be designed to work well on a wide range of web-enabled devices,
    including mobile phones. Stand-alone mobile apps will only be
    considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices,
    and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office
-   use common technology platforms
-   publish as much learning and code with the public as is possible
-   be measured against success in meeting user needs

Where services are outsourced on a payment by results basis we will
ensure a consistent and high quality user experience, aligned with the
digital by default service standard.

An indicative outline of this service standard is
available in Annex 3.

The majority of the benefits will be achieved by the 7 transactional
departments. Therefore we will focus on redesigning their services as a
first priority, with three ‘exemplar’ services in each of these
departments receiving end to end redesign by March 2015.

Service redesign and prototyping work for these exemplar services will
start in April 2013 or earlier. For each service identified for
redevelopment, a proposed delivery plan will be prepared, showing how
the department will resource the project including meeting the
challenges in senior digital leadership, appointing a suitably skilled
Service Manager to lead from the inception of the redesign process, and
undertaking service design and project and product management. Any
funding required will be found by departments from within existing
budgets, re-prioritised where necessary.

Departments will share the learning from the transformation of these
exemplar services to increase digital capability across the civil
service.

All departments will redesign all their transactional services that
handle over 100,000 transactions each year for completion by the end of
the next spending review period. In November 2012 there were [152 transactions that met this threshold](http://transactionalservices.alphagov.co.uk/).
In exceptional circumstances departments may seek an exemption from this requirement; for example where a business case for digital by default service design does not demonstrate good value for money. Any put forward would be agreed at a cross-government level.

Departments will identify which services they transform first, for
agreement with Cabinet Office. Annex 4 identifies a number of criteria
which departments should consider when selecting which services to
redesign to ensure the greatest benefit to users and savings to
government. We recognise that DWP’s introduction of Universal Credit
means that a major and wide-reaching digital transformation programme
affecting all areas of the department is already underway. As such,
Cabinet Office will take a flexible approach as to any further
commitments to redesigning services prior to March 2015.

Cabinet Office will measure progress annually and publish the
results.

Departments with direct responsibility for fewer than 1 million
transactions each year will transfer their information on to [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/), but
their departmental digital strategies will include clear plans for the
future transformation of their services to digital by default.

The Government Digital Service is already supporting 7 transactional
transformation projects across central government (see table below). It
will increase the scale of this support.

### Principle: Complete the transition to GOV.UK

*“Simpler, clearer and faster for users”*

####Action 07: Corporate publishing activities of all 24 central government departments will move onto GOV.UK by March 2013, with agency and arm's length bodies' online publishing to follow by March 2014

-   resources for the transition to GOV.UK will be included in
    departmental digital strategies

Government Digital Service will:

-   help departments to transfer online publishing to GOV.UK
-   continue to operate and improve the GOV.UK online publishing
    platform at no cost to departments, agencies or arms length bodies

In October 2012, government took the first step towards enabling access
to all departments’, agencies’ and arms length bodies’ digital
information and transactional services to citizens and businesses using
one web address. GOV.UK has replaced Directgov and Businesslink.gov.uk as a
single domain for government on the web.

GOV.UK has demonstrated how these methodologies can deliver high quality
digital products that meet user needs, and are more efficient for
government. [In large scale user testing](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/01/13/quantitative-testing-betagov/), 93% of users rated GOV.UK as
very/quite easy to use versus 75% for Directgov. Similarly, when looking
for information, respondents using GOV.UK took an average of 80 seconds,
as opposed to 120 seconds on Directgov.

Between November 2012 to March 2013, the corporate publishing activities
of 24 government departments will move onto GOV.UK. By March 2014, the
information publishing aspects of all department, agency and arms length
bodies websites (other than those granted a specific business-based
exemption) will transfer to GOV.UK.

### Principle: Increase the number of people who use digital services

*“More users, using more services, more often”*

####Action 08: Departments will raise awareness of their digital services so that more people know about them and use them

-   departments will set out plans to encourage channel shift in
    departmental digital strategies. These will be reviewed annually
-   departments will publish plans that clearly identify the
    savings they expect to make as a result of increased use of
    digital services


Government Digital Service will:

-   share examples of success across departments

In order to maximise the benefits from transformed digital services,
departments must work to accelerate their take-up, shifting users able
to access the internet away from non-digital channels. Departmental
digital strategies will include clear plans for encouraging the move
from offline to digital channels, through awareness raising, involvement
of front-line staff and appropriate use of incentives.

Departments will re-assess the effectiveness of their promotional
activities to maximise the awareness of new and existing digital
services, and encourage those who could use them to trial them. This
does not have to involve expensive marketing campaigns. It will build on
service experience and expertise in behavioural insight and behaviour
change in the public and private sectors to raise the profile of digital
services, and encourage users to use them.

A key element of the channel shift approach will involve existing
front-line staff (both face to face and telephony). They should be made
proficient in the use of digital services and encouraged, trained and
equipped to support people in trialling and using the services
themselves (for example by having the same front end access to a service
system as the user, making explanation and support more
straightforward). As digital take-up increases, the role of front-line
staff may evolve.

As well as ensuring users are aware of digital channels, the transition
to digital as the channel of choice can be facilitated by use of
incentives. A number of techniques have been trialled, such as passing
on lower costs where fees are based on cost recovery, as Companies House
did for company registrations; allowing later deadlines for online
process completion, as used in HMRC’s personal tax assessment
transactions; or by entries into prize draws for online users, as
offered by DVLA. Departments will be encouraged to trial a range of
positive incentives to encourage digital adoption.

The Government Digital Service will work with Service Managers to
collate and share experience and tools developed through initial
transformation projects, as well as drawing in appropriate expertise
from the commercial sector to share experience and techniques for
facilitating channel shift.

### Principle: Provide consistent services for people who have rarely or never been online

*“Services for everyone entitled to them”*

####Action 09: There will be a cross-government approach to assisted digital. This means that people who have rarely or never been online will be able to access services offline, and we will provide additional ways for them to use the digital services

{include action09-case-study.md}

This means that people who have rarely or never been online will be
able to access services offline, and we will provide additional ways for
them to use the digital services

-   departments will explain in their digital strategies how they will
    ensure that digital services include a consistent service for people
    who have rarely or never been online


Government Digital Service will continue to:

-   work with departments to agree a cross-government approach to
    [assisted digital](/digital/assisted/), published in December 2012
-   work with organisations representing people who can't use digital
    services to develop the cross-government approach


The government has to provide public services to everyone who is
entitled to them. [18% of adults have rarely or never been online](/digital/research/#fig-1).
Digital by default means that digital self-service is the default option
for people who can use it, not the only option.

To ensure that people who are offline can access digital by default
services, we will offer them ways to access services offline, and we
will provide additional ways for them to use the digital services. These
services must be designed to meet user needs. We call this ‘assisted
digital’.

We need to make sure that government takes a consistent approach to
providing services for people who have rarely or never been online. This
will be better for users and more efficient for government.

The approach will include a range of possible ways to provide services
for people who are rarely or never online, depending on what the user
needs are and how complex the service is. For example, for simpler
transactions with a small proportion of users who don’t use online
services, departments may use contact centres to provide another way to
access the service. For more complex transactions and a high proportion
of people who are not online, departments may use a mix of face to face,
phone and paper support. Face to face support may involve having people
helping users to do their transaction on terminals, or a user being able
to give their details to a person who will enter it into the digital
service on their behalf.

Front-line staff have a vital role to play. They will support users who
need help with digital services and continue to provide other ways for
people who are not online to access services. Private or voluntary and
community sector organisations may also be involved.

The Government Digital Service, departments and stakeholders including Age UK, Post Office, Online Centres Foundation, Citizens Advice, Go ON UK, Society of Chief Librarians, Digital Unite, Communications Consumer Panel, Carers UK, UCanDoIT, Shelter, Shaw Trust, and Lasa are working together on the cross-government approach to assisted digital. 
Within government, we are also working with Arts Council England and BDUK.

The government will publish plans by December 2012. Departmental digital strategies will also reflect these plans.

This strategy is not about generally encouraging more people to go
online, or increasing people’s skills to use digital services.
Departments with larger proportions of users who are not online may wish
to supplement their assisted digital provision with activity to increase
the digital capability of their users. If so, this would be funded by
existing departmental budgets. As well as developing the approach to
assisted digital, the Government Digital Service is collaborating with
Go ON UK in their work to help make the UK the most digitally capable
nation in the world.

### Principle: Broaden the range of those tendering to supply digital services including more small and medium sized enterprises

*“Get the best bidders bidding”*

####Action 10: Cabinet Office will offer leaner and more lightweight tendering processes, as close to the best practice in industry as our regulatory requirements allow

{include action10-case-study.md}

It will:

-   work with departments as part of its strategic supplier management
    function to maintain a forward looking pipeline of digital work,
    updated quarterly. This will enable businesses to invest in
    capability and resources appropriately
-   use the existing spend controls process to encourage better
    pre-market engagement, shaping specifications to take advantage
    where appropriate of the market’s latest offerings and innovations
-   encourage suppliers who are new to government to undertake any bidder training needed to lower the effective barrier to entry for new
    vendors, as part of the existing commitment to ensure 25% of
    departmental external spend is with small and medium sized enterprises


Government Digital Service will continue to:

-   offer training and awareness-raising to departmental procurement
    leads in support of new procurement arrangements 

In 2009, [the public sector spent around 1% of GDP on IT](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/317444/ict_strategy4.pdf). Departments
currently rely on a few, large systems integrators to supply their
digital requirements. They can lack the in-house expertise to act as a
challenging and informed client, and this has resulted in expensive and
inflexible long-term contracts which do not support delivery of services
likely to meet the forthcoming digital service standard.

However, the UK has a burgeoning digital technology sector with a wide
range of highly skilled and innovative companies, including small and medium sized enterprises who are
often unable to access the government procurement market due to high
barriers to entry and complex, expensive and often frustrating
processes.

The need to redesign services to be digital by default is an opportunity
to secure greater value for government, by changing how we commission
our services, developing in-house capabilities and reducing our reliance
on a few large systems integrators. Cabinet Office will build on
existing procurement reform to develop new commissioning arrangements
for digital projects, to encourage a wider range of bidders, including
small and medium sized enterprises.

This will be accompanied by training and awareness raising for
departmental procurement leads on the requirements for the new approach.
To achieve this shift, there will be a recognition that work
will not inevitably go to the cheapest bidder, but that more flexible
contracts with suppliers will be explored and assessed with a view to
what longer-term value they will bring to government by providing agile
and scalable solutions that meet user needs.

A number of new techniques will be introduced to the commissioning
process to enable departments to gain a deeper understanding of the
capabilities of prospective suppliers. These may include collaborative
procurement techniques where face to face time is maximised with
prospective suppliers and scenarios are used to understand supplier
capabilities and approaches. Another technique may see the use of
prototyping, where ‘model’ systems will be constructed for prospective
suppliers to prove their integration capabilities and technical prowess
of their staff. Both of these methods will be supported by fair and
objective scoring.

The [ICT Strategy](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/government-ict-strategy) stressed the need for government to procure its
technical infrastructure - its servers, internet hosting, etc - as
commodity services. The [CloudStore](http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/) framework is an example of this shift,
with over 300 suppliers offering cloud-based solutions on a
pay-as-you-use basis, with a maximum 12 months contract. The learning
from the development of the CloudStore framework will be fed into other
digital procurement and commissioning reform.

### Principle: Build common technology platforms for digital by default services

*“Develop on platforms, not in silos”*

####Action 11: Cabinet Office will lead in the definition and delivery of a new suite of common technology platforms which will underpin the new generation of digital services

{include action11-case-study.md}

-   the IT Reform Group in the Cabinet Office will explain the
    benefits of a platform approach to departments and then incorporate
    as appropriate in a refreshed IT strategy


Government Digital Service will:

-   extend the range of platforms it supports beyond digital
    publishing (for [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/)) to data insight, identity assurance and
    further common platform components
-   help to define, develop and provide shared technology platforms to
    support digital by default services 

Cabinet Office will lead in the definition and delivery of a range
of common cross-government technology platforms, in consultation with
departments to ensure they meet business needs. These will underpin the
new generation of digital services. Departments will be
expected to use these for new and redesigned services, unless a specific
case for exemption is agreed.

We know that our users often find it hard to register for our online
services, so it is vital that we offer a more straightforward, secure
way to allow our users to identify themselves online while preserving
their privacy. The Identity Assurance programme in the Cabinet Office
will continue to develop a framework to enable federated identity
assurance to be adopted across government services in due course. All
our work in this area is guided by the [Identity and Privacy Principles](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/04/24/identityand-privacy-principles/)
drawn up by our Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group.

The Government Digital Service is also developing a data insight
platform that will combine a range of data including analytics, web
operations and financial information. Using clear visualisations, it
will provide high level performance reports for leaders and more
detailed data for Service Managers.

### Principle: Remove unnecessary legislative barriers

*“A letter shouldn't have to be on paper”*

####Action 12: Cabinet Office will continue to work with departments to remove legislative barriers which unecessarily prevent the development of straightforward and convenient digital services

-   departments will identify existing legislative barriers in their departmental digital strategies


Government Digital Service will:

-   offer specialist digital expertise to interpret existing legislation

In a few areas, laws made before the digital age can severely constrain
the development of simple, convenient digital services. For
example, HMRC have to provide tax coding notifications on paper rather
than by electronic channels. Cabinet Office will work with
departments to identify these potential barriers and ways to remove
them. This could mean either reviewing current restrictive
interpretations of laws passed before digital methods existed or, in
some cases, by considering whether legislation needs to be changed. The [Red Tape Challenge](http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) is examining some 6,500 substantive
regulations and identifying at least 3,000 to scrap or overhaul. This includes finding ways to reduce burdens for businesses, taxpayers and individuals by moving to digital methods.

Policy and legal experts will work closely with digital specialists and
those who are responsible for designing services to find a solution to
any problems identified. We will hold these discussions early in each
design process and continue them throughout development (some may also
emerge during implementation and operational stages). We will share the
solutions widely across departments to help with consistency and
smoother joint working.

### Principle: Base service decisions on accurate and timely management information

*“Data trumps intuition”*

####Action 13: Departments will supply a consistent set of management information (as defined by Cabinet Office) for their transactional services

{include action13-case-study.md}

-   departments will begin reporting against defined data-sets from
    April 2013
-   digital by default services will include automated collection of
    management information


Government Digital Service will:

-   share a list of required data sets with departments by December 2012
-   help departments to define, collect, store and present performance data


Service Managers and decision-makers need high quality, consistent
management information to make sound decisions and help them monitor and
improve performance. Some services collect and assess detailed
performance data but most digital services still do not have good enough
management information.

Cabinet Office will establish a consistent set of management
information measures which departments will use, meaning they can
effectively compare performance across time and against similar
services. Collection of this information will be built into every new or
redesigned digital service.

Reliable management information makes it possible for good performers to be
identified and given recognition. Service performance will not only be
bench-marked against historical performance, but also standards
recognised as best practice.

Service performance will be measured through a clear and consistent set
of indicators. These will include:

-   cost per transaction. This measures whether a service is using a
    cost-effective set of delivery channels and whether users are
    choosing to use more or less expensive channels to complete their
    transaction
-   user satisfaction. This enables Service Managers to identify
    potential weaknesses in a service and areas to focus improvement
    efforts
-   transaction completion rates. This may highlight possible process
    flaws or ambiguities in the service although abandonment measures
    have to be designed and monitored with an understanding of each
    transaction stage (for example, identifying where users drop out as
    a result of establishing that they are ineligible for a service in
    the course of an application)
-   take-up levels. This illustrates how rapidly users are adopting
    new digital channels and where additional or different marketing may
    be useful

### Principle: Improve the way that the government makes policy and communicates with people

*“Open policy making will become the default”*

####Action 14: Policy teams will use digital tools and techniques to engage with and consult the public

{include action14-case-study.md}

-   departments will incorporate plans in their departmental digital
    strategies to listen to and understand conversations in social
    media, use the insight gained to inform the policy-making process
    and to collaborate more effectively with partners


Government Digital Service will:

-   continue to offer support, training and guidance to departments
-   release a range of tools on the [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) platform to enable policy
    teams to engage and consult more effectively
-   keep the civil service social media guidance up to date

Transactional services and information are the primary focus of our
digital by default approach, but digital also provides ways to improve
the broader policy making process, through better engagement and
consultation. It has the potential to transform democratic participation in the policy process, and improve the design of policy itself. The [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform) states 
*“Open policy making will become the default”* and we will use digital to achieve that outcome.

We have already developed better skills in listening and responding to
public feedback through digital channels. In May 2012, social media
guidelines were issued to civil servants based on 6 principles – that
government should:

-   communicate with citizens in the places they already are
-   use social media to consult and engage
-   use social media to be more transparent and accountable
-   be part of the conversation with all the benefits that brings
-   understand that government can’t do everything alone
-   expect civil servants to adhere to the [Civil Service Code](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/about/values) (online
    as well as offline)

Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said: 

> “When civil servants, policy makers and service delivery units alike, open
themselves to dialogue with the public they can glean a much better
understanding of the real needs and concerns of citizens. They can keep
up to date with the latest thinking as well as being a listening post
and avenue for real time reassurance and information”.

Civil servants are exploring the opportunities social media offers,
whether by entering into dialogue, consulting and engaging, improving their policy making or
simply listening to people’s concerns. For example, Department of Health
made a draft Bill openly available for comment online using social media
in July 2012. This increased openness and made it straightforward for
people to comment on individual clauses or topics before the Bill was
introduced to Parliament. This ran alongside other offline stakeholder
engagement. The Red Tape Challenge website 'crowd sources' views from business, organisations and the public on which regulations should be improved, kept 'as is' or scrapped. These comments have directly influenced [the decisions to scrap or overhaul](https://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/progess-to-date) over 1,100 regulations (of the 2,300 examined by November 2012).

Departments will train and develop policy teams to understand and use a
wider range of digital methods and channels. They will use these to
engage and consult with the public on a daily basis around areas of
policy development, up to and including formal consultations. Cabinet
Office will also provide training to policy teams on the potential of
digital by default approaches as they draw up policy proposals.

We are developing a range of consultation and engagement tools as part
of GOV.UK, supported by guidance to civil servants on effective online
consultation techniques and approaches.

##02 Introduction

This strategy contains 14 actions the government will take to
become digital by default. Digital by default means digital services
which are so straightforward and convenient that all those who can use
digital services will choose to do so, while those who can’t are not
excluded.

This follows the [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform) by developing services
that:

-   allow straightforward access to information and services in times
    and in ways that are convenient to the users rather than the
    providers
-   are more efficient and cost-effective to develop and run

If we successfully transform our services so they are digital by
default, we can earn a reputation for offering high-quality, responsive, convenient and
up-to-date services.

We made this commitment in response to the review
of Government Online ['Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution not Evolution’](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution) carried out by Martha Lane Fox as UK
Digital Champion in 2010.

In his foreword to the [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform), Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude said:

> “Central Government where possible must become a digital organisation.
These days the best service organisations deliver online everything that can be
delivered online.
This cuts their costs dramatically and allows access to information and
services at times and in ways convenient to the users rather than the
providers”.

The [Government Digital Service](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/) will implement this strategy, supported
by the Digital Leaders’ network of senior civil servants, the [Digital
Advisory Board](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/04/25/introducing-the-digital-advisory-board/) and the [Government Communication Network](https://gcn.civilservice.gov.uk/).

Each government department will prepare and publish its own departmental
digital strategy. These documents will explain how departments will make
their services digital by default in ways that work for their users.
These strategies will be published by the end of 2012, in time to
influence departments’ 2013/14 planning process. They will set the
framework for service transformation over the lifetime of the next
spending review.

Watch Tim O’Reilly, the founder and CEO of O'Reilly Media, talk about the
importance of focusing on user needs and how the Government Digital Strategy
is “inspiring” because of its focus on user centred design.

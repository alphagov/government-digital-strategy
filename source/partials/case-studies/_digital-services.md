Roo Reynolds been working on ambitious new projects to turn inefficient, outdated and entirely paper-based government services into cutting-edge digital ones.

The aim isn't to simply digitise what was there before, but to make the new service as good as the best things people are already using on the internet. 

That means starting with what people actually need, and iterating through lots of small changes.

Start with the smallest, simplest thing that could possibly work, and build from there

*"We start with the smallest, simplest thing that could possibly work, and build gradually from there,"* says Roo.

One of these projects is for the [Office of the Public Guardian](http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/opg). It handles the process of setting up lasting power of attorney for people who, for one reason or another, need someone else to take over the handling of their financial and legal affairs.

The only way this was possible until now was by filling in a lengthy and intimidating paper form. The majority of applicants had to get legal experts to help them fill it in, and even those experts sometimes made mistakes. 

*"It was a painful process,"* says Roo. *"at what, for many people, is a very difficult moment in life. We wanted to see if we could make it simpler and faster."*

A prototype web service was built within weeks, and is now undergoing user testing.

Another example: to support the government's proposed change from household to individual voter registration, the new service will be digitised. The Electoral Registration Transformation Programme aims to make the whole process faster and easier and to cut down on the huge amount of paperwork currently handled by electoral services teams nationwide. 

Crucial to both of these projects - and many more to come - is the approach the team is using while building them. 

*"You get early feedback from all the people whose opinions can help you change what you're building.*

*"It sounds really obvious but it's not the way government has always worked in the past.”*

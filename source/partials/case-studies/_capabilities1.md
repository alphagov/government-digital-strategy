Roger Oldham describes his work as *“incredibly motivating,”* and with good reason. He’s in charge of the new Digital Services Division inside the Ministry of Justice, a team of skilled experts working on cutting edge new ideas for the department. 

The Ministry of Justice is undergoing a radical transformation to modernise the way it works, improve services, and save several billion pounds. Digital is critical for success. It’s Roger’s job to ensure that the right people are there to provide expert help for everyone across a business with around 66,000 people, from top to bottom.

*“For senior management and policy and operational colleagues, that means giving them an understanding of what digital can do for their business area - so that digital thinking becomes part of their day-to-day,”* he explains.

There's so much opportunity to pioneer a new way of doing government

That means hiring people for what aren’t often considered ‘traditional’ civil service roles. Roger’s team includes web developers, strategists, agile delivery managers, product managers and user experience designers, all available to work on specific projects run by the team, or to provide expertise to other parts of the department. The aim is to build *“a centre of expertise”* that benefits the whole of the department.

For example, they are currently developing a digital tool to enable users to find out whether they’re eligible for legal aid; last year the department helped 1.9 million people with these enquiries. According to Roger, *"This should provide people with a quicker and more convenient way to find out if they can get legal aid, and save us money by helping to ensure that only those eligible are passed on to a specialist advisor. People who aren’t eligible will be automatically directed to other forms of help and information"*. The result? The right outcome for users and less reliance on call centres.

This, along with other projects, are pioneering, pace-setting efforts. Roger’s work is expected to be the template for future similar digital divisions in other government departments. This is new territory, and Roger and his team are the trailblazers.

He relishes the challenge: *“You’ve got to have a very clear vision of what you’re trying to achieve. You need to be focused on the fact that you’re not going to be able to do everything for everybody.”*

It’s not always easy and there are tough conversations to be had. So is he enjoying his role? Roger says: *“It’s incredibly motivating to be working in government at this particular time when so much is changing, when there’s so much opportunity to pioneer a different way of doing government.”*

*“The opportunity to make a difference, to be contributing to something greater than yourself …  how could I not be having fun?”*

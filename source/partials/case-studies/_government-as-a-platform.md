Even in this digital age, new government legislation is still published on sheets of vellum that are stored safely away inside the National Archives.

But another team at the Archives is responsible for a world-leading project which uses an up-to-date publishing system to put all legislation online in a powerful, data-driven website: legislation.gov.uk.

John Sheridan leads this. His team had the challenge of building a publishing system for legislation, which is *“very unusual content.”* They’ve found a way to show legislation as a properly laid out legal document, and simultaneously to publish the meaning of that legislation as data that a computer can understand and interpret.

The whole site has been built using open standards. Everything that can be shared with the rest of the world, has been shared.

*“All of the data we have can be used for free. All of our source code is available for free. We’ve used open standards for everything. We make it very easy to use the data in your own product or service.”*

That’s done using an API - a gateway that other services can use to connect directly to the legislative database and extract information from it. Rather than build a website and then try to plug a database into it, they worked the other way round. The data and the API came first, and the website was built on top. 

That was the only feasible way of doing it, says John. *“You simply could not write a specification for a system that is that difficult to build. If you did you would spend a year just writing the spec rather than a year writing code.”*

The site is open to others to use, but benefits by providing a feedback loop. Third parties using the data, including legal reference information services such as Longman Law Bespoke and the Practical Law Company, are motivated to keep it up-to-date and accurate. With their help, updates and edits are made faster.

All our data can be used for free... We use open standards for everything

As a result, legislation.gov.uk is doing solving a problem that’s been troubling successive governments for over 100 years: it’s creating a fully up-to-date copy of the Statute Book. 

John is confident that his team’s open-access, open-data model can be put to use in all sorts of areas.

*“By making our data open and making a mechanism for people to feedback and contribute, we’re able to create a new type of public good. If we can manage a database as complex as this one, we can do that with others.”*

## Saving money, transforming services, making progress

** *[some headline options]* **

Great progress on transformation - lots of work to be done

Making progress, more to do

Progress made, but we can do better

**[intro]**

So far, we're making fantastic progress with our todo list. GOV.UK is an award-winning website and continues to grow, but now our primary focus is on digital transformation. In the last few months, we've started work on renewing 25 of the biggest and most-used transactional public services - we call them exemplars, leading the way for others to follow. We’ve worked really hard, but not made as much progress as we’d like, and there’s still a huge amount of work to do. We’ve made a good start. We're rebuilding government services for the way people live today. 

**[Short list]**

Since April 2013, we've:

* announced savings of £500m, of which £42m was the result of replacing DirectGov and BusinessLink with GOV.UK

* finished moving 24 ministerial departments to GOV.UK, and started moving 300 other government agencies and public bodies

* published the [Digital by Default Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default), and a [Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) to help people use it

* moved 13 exemplar services to discovery phase, 6 to alpha, 5 to beta, and put elements of 1 live

* started recruiting and training Service Managers to run them

The [Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/) was published in November 2012. It included a list of 14 actions for building government services that are digital by default. [Each government department has its own digital strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/#departmental-strategies), setting out what it will do to respond to those actions.

We’re monitoring the work done on these actions, and keeping track of the progress made. Every 3 months, we publish a short summary of what’s been done. This is the second of those reports (the [first](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/quarterly-reports/april-13/) was published in April 2013). 

Since then, we’ve done a great deal of work, often behind the scenes, and confirmed multi-million pound cost savings. We haven’t got as far as we would have liked, and some work has slipped behind schedule. But we hope to fix these problems soon.

**[Main body begins - vids and images to be embedded where marked]**

In the 3 months between April and June, we:

* provided more help to departments as they recruit the skilled people they need to make digital transformation happen

* ran the Service Manager induction course for the first time

* published the [Digital by Default Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) and its accompanying [Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)

* moved the 25 digital exemplars forward; by the end of June, 13 were in discovery phase, 6 were in alpha, 5 in beta, and elements of 1 were live

* moved 6 more ministerial department websites to GOV.UK, and started work on 300 more websites for other government agencies and public bodies 

* won two prestigious national awards for GOV.UK design and content

* continued work on a series of government-wide technology and policy platforms (in areas such as assisted digital, identity assurance, digital engagement and open policy making)

* took on the job of organising a cross-government plan for digital inclusion

* announced savings of £500m, mostly as a result of IT spend controls and moving government services and transactions to digital platforms. Of that, £42m was the result of replacing Directgov and BusinessLink with GOV.UK.

Overall, we are making good progress on our Digital Strategy todo list. Some projects were delayed because a funding issue held up recruitment, which meant we didn’t have enough people to do all the work. That’s something we’re already tackling.

In the next 3 months (July to September 2013), we plan to: 

* take our Service Manager Induction training live, and integrate digital into existing training for senior civil servants;

* help departments find specialist digital staff from inside and outside government through a Recruitment Hub based in GDS; 

* find ways to help Whitehall make the most of technology and recruit senior civil servants who understand it better

* complete discovery on all 25 exemplar services and take x of them live

* move more than 30 agency and arms length body websites to GOV.UK

* create an online library of best practice case studies to help departments with digital policy-making

* set up a new digital inclusion team to start work on a digital inclusion strategy, and identify opportunities for partnerships between the public, private, voluntary and community sectors to help people get online.

The [Civil Service Capabilities Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/capabilities-plan-for-the-civil-service), published in April, identified digital capability (in other words, having civil servants who understand technology and know how to build, maintain and run services) as a high priority. [GDS has helped by: ](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-04)

* advising departments (including the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Home Office) on how to recruit senior people with the right digital and technology skills, and integrate those roles with the rest of the team

* running an Alpha of the [Service Manager induction and development programme](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-02), and using what we’ve learned from it to build a Beta version for July

* making 4 videos for civil servants, explaining the ways digital technology is already being used to transform services 

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has appointed a new [Digital Leader](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-01), as have half of the agencies within the Department for Business, Industry and Skills (BIS), which has also completed its own [digital capability review](http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/bisdigital/2013/06/25/delivering-our-digital-strategy-an-update-on-the-bis-digital-capability-review/). 

 

Other [departments are working on building their own teams](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-03):

* The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) set up a team covering portfolio management, product management, training and digital policy development

* Department for Environment and Climate Change (DECC) has established a small team to work on digital programme management, capability building, and service design and delivery

* Ministry of Defence (MOD) and Department for International Development (DfID) are setting up new roles or repurposing existing job descriptions

* Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) are planning digital skills training for staff. DCMS is doing this alongside work on [a new intranet](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/18/intranets-dcms/) built using agile thinking at a fraction of the cost of the site it replaces

Following the closure of the cross-government Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Head of Profession for ICT positions, GDS has started reviewing the best ways to [run and use technology](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/06/04/reforming-governance-in-government-technology/), interviewing senior leaders across government and the private sector to find out what works for them and how it might be put to use elsewhere.

**Service design and operation **

[insert screengrab of Service Manual homepage]

The [Government Service Design Manual](http://www.gov.uk/service-manual), published in mid-April, aims to help departments achieve the Digital by Default Service Standard. It got a positive reception, attracting attention internationally from both public and private sector organisations. Work continues on iterating and improving it in response to user feedback.

[Meeting the Standard will be mandatory for all new and redesigned services handling over 100,000 transactions each year from April 2014](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-06). Initial assessment against the Standard has already started for new services applying to be made available via GOV.UK, looking at each one’s:

* fit with user needs

* capacity to develop and improve

* adherence to information security rules

Ten assessments have been done so far. Three services passed, subject to meeting certain requirements. These are: Academic Technology Approval Scheme (FCO), Cloudstore (CO), and Office of the Public Guardian (MoJ).  All services assessed so far began development before the Service Standard existed. Those needing to make further improvements before coming back for reassessment have been given detailed feedback on what work they need to do to achieve a pass.

**Service transformations**

[insert 25 logo]

The Government Digital Strategy asked departments to [identify ‘exemplar’ services for transformation](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-05). We have begun work on all 25 exemplar services across eight different departments. Progress has been good; but was held back by delays in recruiting staff. We expect the rest of the projects to complete discovery by the end of August. 

We will then have:

* the transformation strategy and business case for each service

* a way to review and revise what’s included in the exemplar work

* a delivery plan for each service and for the overarching GDS programme that will support this

Agile working methods are catching on within departments, most notably in Land Registry (where team members are going through certified training) and in Defra. Agile coaches are employed alongside a number of projects to complement the work of the GDS Transformation Team. 

There are still issues to resolve across a number of departments around procurement support, IT provision and improving the rules we work within. To get the most from new digital services, they need to be developed as a part of wider business change, which is why we are looking at how organisational structures and culture need to adapt, alongside improving skills in the team.

The [assisted digital](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-09) team has started working with exemplar services (CAP Delivery, Lasting Power of Attorney, Civil Claims and Prisoner Visits Booking). They are gathering ideas for assisted digital provision in an open way, and collating data about user needs. There is an[ Assisted Digital Action Plan](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan.html) in the Service Manual to help with this. 

GDS held 2 events in June for potential providers from commercial and voluntary sectors, and Department for Transport (DFT), Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), HMRC and DWP gave presentations. The assisted digital team is [blogging regularly](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/assisted-digital/) about its work. 

Service redesign is not just for exemplars. Other departments are transforming services they identified in their departmental strategies. 

Examples include:

* the [Development Tracker](http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/) by DfID, released in Beta in June, using open data to allow people to view information about UK development projects (including documents and detailed financial transactions)

* Crisis Hub, being developed as an agile project to support FCO’s crisis response. The supplier is an SME procured through the G Cloud framework

**GOV.UK**

[insert graph showing visits since launch]

All ministerial departments have now [moved their corporate information publishing across to GOV.UK](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-07). Usage of GOV.UK rose steadily. Average daily visits exceeded 1.3 million throughout April.

Also that month, GOV.UK was awarded the prestigious [Design of the Year award](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/govuk-wins-design-of-the-year-2013). Judges unanimously voted for GOV.UK for its "well thought out, yet understated design". This was followed in June by GOV.UK winning a both a yellow pencil and the coveted  black pencil at the Design and Art Direction ([D&AD) awards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hvFXnCZGF8).

We [improved search](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/06/11/improving-site-search-on-gov-uk/#more-11940) on the site, based on user feedback, behaviour analytics, and different user needs.

Work began to move agency and arm’s length body websites across to GOV.UK.  Despite some delays caused by confirming funding to recruit specialist content editors, around 15% of these sites have already been moved.

**Digital inclusion**

[insert Assisted Digital video?]

In mid-June, BIS released the [Information Economy Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/information-economy-strategy) (IEIS) to boost growth for digital industries. 

This announced that the Government Digital Service (GDS) will be the base for a [new cross-government team](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/06/14/introducing-digital-inclusion-team/) to co-ordinate work to help people and businesses get online. It will:

* develop a strategy for digital skills activity in central government, linked to digital inclusion work from elsewhere

* act as a central point for collaboration on digital skills projects, and work with departments to build digital skills into the policy development process

* build and maintain knowledge on ‘what works’ in digital inclusion, and use this for planning future activity

Other work to improve internet access is being undertaken by DCMS, where £680 million is being invested to make [broadband faster and more reliable](http://www.gov.uk/government/policies/transforming-uk-broadband).

**Other Government-wide initiatives supporting departmental digital work**

[insert ?]

New common platforms are being developed:

* [Transactions Explorer](http://transactionsexplorer.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/) had its second release, with updated data on over 600 transactions across government. It now contains data on digital take-up as well as additional data on the [70 highest volume services](http://transactionsexplorer.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/highVolumeTransactions), showing some of the [key performance indicators used to assess transactional services](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-13) 

* The [Performance Platform](https://www.gov.uk/performance) was released, with dashboards for all the different licences, notices, and registrations that people and organisations can apply for. These will be the first of many similar platform services

* The [GOV.UK blogging platform](https://blog.gov.uk/) was launched, initially featuring a ‘history of government’ blog operated by the The National Archives. Existing blogs will soon be migrated to the new platform

The [Identity Assurance Programme](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/10/04/less-about-identity-more-about-trust/) is:

* working with 9 central government departments and over 20 services

* talking to other service providers interested in learning more (such as Money Advice Service, the Welsh and Scottish Governments, and several local authorities) 

HMRC announced that it would be the first government department to use the new Identity Assurance reference hub for the PAYE Online exemplar service,  launching in October 2013. 

In June, the Identity Assurance Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group published an [updated version of identity principles](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/id-assurance/) which focus on privacy and consumer expectations of users. 

Departments agreed to highlight any [legislative barriers](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-12) that might get in the way of building digital processes and services. For example, requiring a "wet signature" on paper for citizens to get through some services. Departments are assessing whether and how these could be changed. 

They are also exploring the [use of digital tools to engage with the public and improve policy-making](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-14), and we are pulling together examples of ways to do it well. 

Already:

* DCLG launched an open policy-making project using social media channels to get public feedback on a range of campaigns, including ‘Fire Kills’ and ‘Right to Buy’

* DCMS trialled a blogging platform to talk to people about the[ Women’s Business Council Report](http://womensbusinesscouncil.dcms.gov.uk). This was successful and will be used for future engagement projects

* The Digital Services Division within Ministry of Justice (MoJ) launched a live [blog](http://blogs.justice.gov.uk/digital/) to highlight its work and invite discussion on it. This has been used in an open policy making exercise for the Criminal Justice System

* The Digital Communications Team within BIS is working to embed digital tools in the policy-making process. Early case studies were published in May on the[ digital@BIS](http://discuss.bis.gov.uk/bisdigital/) blog

* FCO has shared case studies on how to use digital to improve foreign policy work on its [digital diplomacy blog](http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/digitaldiplomacy/)

**What’s the bottom line?**

The Government Digital Strategy aims to improve services for people and save money at the same time. In 2012/13, we’ve already [saved](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-saves-10-billion-for-taxpayers) about £500m from IT spend controls and moving government services and transactions onto digital platforms. Of that, £42 million was saved by replacing Directgov and BusinessLink with GOV.UK.
